# Test connection to PostgreSQL database
This repo is created to save a snippet of code to connect to the database with psycopg2 library.

For correct work you should create a file `database.ini` with section **posgresql** and provide data
for successful connection to the database. At least 4 items:
1. host
2. user
3. password
4. database
